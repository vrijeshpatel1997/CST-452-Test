# Project ReadMe

## Global CORS Configuration

This project contains a global CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration to allow cross-origin requests for the Spring Boot application. The configuration is set up using the following Java code:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebMvc
public class GlobalCorsConfiguration implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {
        registry.addMapping("/**")
            .allowedOrigins("*")
            .allowedMethods("GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS", "PATCH")
            .allowedHeaders("*");
    }
}
```

## Milestone4 Application

The primary application class, `Milestone4Application`, is responsible for starting the Spring Boot application:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = "com.milestone4")
public class Milestone4Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Milestone4Application.class, args);
    }
}
```

## Product Controller

The `ProductController` class serves as the REST API controller for managing product-related operations, including:

- Creating a new product: `POST /product`
- Getting all products: `GET /products`
- Getting a product by ID: `GET /product/{id}`
- Updating a product: `PUT /product/{id}`
- Deleting a product: `DELETE /products/{id}`
- Handling OPTIONS requests: `OPTIONS /products/{id}`

The controller interacts with the underlying database using the `ProductRepository`.

## Product Model

The `Product` class represents the product entity in the database. It includes fields for `id`, `productName`, `productDescription`, and `price`.

## Product Repository

The `ProductRepository` interface extends `JpaRepository` and is used for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `Product` entity.

## Exception Handling

Exception handling related to product not found scenarios is implemented using custom exception classes and a controller advice:

- `ProductNotFoundException` is a custom exception thrown when a product with a given ID is not found.
- `ProductNotFoundAdvice` is a controller advice class that handles the `ProductNotFoundException` and returns an appropriate error message.

## Tests

Several unit tests are included to ensure the functionality of the application and exception handling:

- `ProductControllerTest` tests various methods of the `ProductController` class.
- `ProductNotFoundExceptionTest` tests the custom exception message in `ProductNotFoundException`.
- `ProductTest` tests the `Product` class for proper attribute setting and validation.

## Features

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration is globally set to allow various HTTP methods and headers from any origin.
- The RESTful API provides endpoints to manage products, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
- Exception handling ensures proper error messages are returned when products are not found.

## Dependencies

- Spring Boot: A framework for creating standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database access and management using the Java Persistence API.
- JUnit 5: A testing framework for unit tests.
- H2 Database: An in-memory database for testing purposes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Milestone4Application` class to start the Spring Boot application.
4. Utilize the provided API endpoints to interact with products.

## API Endpoints

- Create a new product:
    - `POST /product`

- Get all products:
    - `GET /products`

- Get a product by ID:
    - `GET /product/{id}`

- Update a product:
    - `PUT /product/{id}`

- Delete a product:
    - `DELETE /products/{id}`

- OPTIONS request:
    - `OPTIONS /products/{id}`

## Project Requirements Assessment

This project fulfills the following requirements:

- Implements a global CORS configuration to enable cross-origin requests.
- Provides a RESTful API for CRUD operations on product entities.
- Includes exception handling for cases where products are not found.
- Contains unit tests to validate the functionality and exception handling.
- Utilizes Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and JUnit for implementation and testing.

  Test Plan: Component Testing
Test Approach
The component testing approach for the "CST 452 Product Management" project is designed to ensure the functionality and performance of the Product Controller. The focus is on testing individual components or units of the system to verify that they operate correctly.
